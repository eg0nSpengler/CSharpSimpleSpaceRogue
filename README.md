# Simple Space Rogue 

A sci-fi themed roguelike built using [GoRogue](https://github.com/Chris3606/GoRogue) and [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com/).

I began creating this due to the small number of sci-fi roguelikes out there (*Small compared to the number of Fantasy roguelikes, zzzz*)

## I've never played a roguelike before...

Some of my personal favorites are...

 - [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/) 
 - [Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead](https://cataclysmdda.org/)
 - [ASCII Sector](http://www.asciisector.net/) (I*f you've ever played Wing Commander - Privateer, it's literally a 2D ASCII form of it!*)

 ## What does it currently contain?
 The project is on hold for now due to work but here two preview GIF(s) of some generated dungeon(s) for your viewing enjoyment.
