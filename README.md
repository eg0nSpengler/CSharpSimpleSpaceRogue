# Simple Space Rogue 

 *- Simple Space Rogue?*

It's a sci-fi themed roguelike built using [GoRogue](https://github.com/Chris3606/GoRogue) and [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com/).

I began creating this due to the small number of sci-fi roguelikes out there (*Small compared to the number of Fantasy roguelikes, zzzz*)

 ## What does it currently contain?
 The project is on hold for now due to work but here two preview GIF(s) of some generated dungeon(s) for your viewing enjoyment.
